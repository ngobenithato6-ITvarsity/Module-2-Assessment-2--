                  <p>Pocket-lint) - Spider-Man is not just a comic superhero; he's a character in what's called the Spider-Verse, a complex web of Spider-People in alternate universes.The Spider-Man franchise we all know is just one part, and it's a messy one, spanning several reboots over a couple decades. The web-slinger has been portrayed by several actors - most recently by Tom Holland. And although Sony owns the rights to Spider-Man, it has loaned the character to Disney-owned Marvel for some Marvel Cinematic Universe films. </p>
