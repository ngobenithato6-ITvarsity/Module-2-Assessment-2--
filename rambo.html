                  <p> John J. Rambo, played by Sylvester Stallone, has led a bloody life, so after witnessing (and abetting) so much carnage over so many decades, you’ll forgive him for becoming a rancher in his golden years and donning duds that make him look like he’s trying out for the Village People. Stallone’s so vital at 72 as to invite envy, but that makes his 2019 addition to the Rambo franchise — Rambo V: Last Blood — a surprise, especially given that 2008’s Rambo gave the series a solid capper. Once a soldier, always a soldier.</p>
