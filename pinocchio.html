                  <p> I took my 3 with my partner and he hated it. My 3 kids were scared at a number of scenes throughout and I wished I'd read the reviews before taking them... there was me thinking it would be a lovely, magical kids tale! There are some quite disturbing scenes.. Even the Tuna's breathing was enough to give anyone nightmares. A little on the long side too. Having said that it is beautifully filmed, really stunning in places. Certainly different. Good acting from the kids. And the adults, even if many of their characters were weird</p>
